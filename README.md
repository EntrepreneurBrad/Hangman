# **Hangman**

## **Description:**
This project allows the user to play Hangman in their terminal.

A randomly selected word (from over 4700) is selected and the user is able to guess with intelligent animations being performed.
<br><br>

**Possible Future Feature Additions:**
- Larger Selection of Words and Word Groups (i.e. Nouns)
<br><br>

## **How It Works:**
1. *python3 hangman.py*
2. A word and other relevant setup variables are generated
3. The terminal invites the user to enter a letter
4. The computer determines if a correct letter is entered
5. If so the underlines of the word are filled in with the letters
5. Steps 3, 4 & 5 are repeat until all letters are entered or hangman is reached
